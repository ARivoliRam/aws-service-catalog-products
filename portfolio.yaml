        before this will work - they build some resources needed for this to work
        and they provision the SSM params with the

        correct ARNs so this works with no copy and pasting.

        Provisioning this template will create an AWS Account and bootstrap it using
        aws-service-catalog-puppet so you can

        provision products into the account.'
